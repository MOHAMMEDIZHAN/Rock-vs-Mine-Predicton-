Rock vs Mine Detection:

This project is focused on detecting whether an object is a mine or a rock using sonar signals. The detection is performed using a Logistic Regression model trained on sonar data.

Introduction:
In this project, we aim to classify objects detected using sonar signals as either mines or rocks. This classification is crucial for underwater navigation and safety, as distinguishing between these two can prevent accidents and save lives.

Workflow:
1. Collecting Sonar Data:
Sonar data is collected by sending and receiving sonar signals, which help in identifying if an object is a mine or a rock.

2. Data Preprocessing:
The collected data is preprocessed to understand and analyze it. This step includes cleaning the data and preparing it for the machine learning model.

3. Train-Test Split:
The data is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the Logistic Regression model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

4. Using Logistic Regression Model:
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data. Once trained, the model can predict whether a new data point represents a mine or a rock.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset. It contains 208 instances with 60 attributes, representing the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.

Installation:
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a requirements.txt file with the following contents:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Usage

Clone the Repository:
git clone [https://github.com/MOHAMMEDIZHAN/Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.git](https://github.com/MOHAMMEDIZHAN/Rock-vs-Mine-Predicton-)
cd Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

Run the Script:
python RockvsMinePrediction.ipynb

Results:
The Logistic Regression model will output the accuracy of its predictions on the test data. Additionally, it will predict whether a new input represents a mine or a rock.
